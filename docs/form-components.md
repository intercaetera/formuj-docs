## Default form components

Out of the box, Formuj comes with two types of controls - Input and Select. You can use these for simplest use cases, however it is likely that you will quickly outgrow their uses and you will need to create your own custom components.

:::note
You can use the following CSS classes to style the default Formuj controls - by default they do not come with any CSS styles.

- `formuj-control`
- `formuj-label`
- `formuj-input` or `formuj-select`
- `formuj-error`
